--- abstract

Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
which may have different performance and connectivity
characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
establishing a connection more quickly. This document specifies
requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
provides an example algorithm, referred to as "Happy Eyeballs". This
document updates the algorithm description in RFC 8305.

# Introduction

Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
which may have different performance and connectivity
characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
establishing a connection more quickly. This document specifies
requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
provides an example algorithm.

This document defines the algorithm for "Happy Eyeballs", a technique
for reducing user-visible delays on dual-stack hosts. This
definition updates the description in {{?HEV2=RFC8305}}, which
itself obsoleted {{?RFC6555}}.

The Happy Eyeballs algorithm of racing connections to resolved
addresses has several stages to avoid delays to the user whenever
possible, while preferring the use of IPv6. This document discusses
how to handle DNS queries when starting a connection on a dual-stack
client, how to create an ordered list of destination addresses to
which to attempt connections, and how to race the connection
attempts.

As compared to {{HEV2}}, this document adds support for incorporating
SVCB / HTTPS resource records (RRs)
{{!SVCB=I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https}}. SVCB RRs provide alternative
endpoints and associated information about protocol support, Encrypted
ClientHello {{!ECH=I-D.ietf-tls-esni}} keys, address hints, among
other relevant hints which may help speed up connection establishment
and improve user privacy. Discovering protocol support during
resolution, such as for HTTP/3 over QUIC {{?RFC9114}}, allows
upgrading between protocols on the current connection attempts,
instead of waiting for subsequent attempts to use information from
other discovery mechanisms such as HTTP Alternative Services
{{?AltSvc=RFC7838}}. These records can be queried along with A and
AAAA records, and the updated algorithm defines how to handle SVCB
responses to improve address and protocol selection.

#  Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Overview

This document defines a method of connection establishment, named the
"Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup". This approach has several
distinct phases:

1. Initiation of asynchronous DNS queries ({{query}})

1. Sorting of resolved destination addresses ({{sorting}})

1. Initiation of asynchronous connection attempts ({{connections}})

1. Establishment of one connection, which cancels all other attempts
({{connections}})

Note that this document assumes that the preference policy for the
host destination address favors IPv6 over IPv4. IPv6 has many
desirable properties designed to be improvements over IPv4
{{?IPV6=RFC8200}}.

This document also assumes that the preference policy favors QUIC over
TCP. QUIC only requires one packet to establish a secure connection,
making it quicker compared to TCP {{?QUIC=RFC9000}}.

If the host is configured to have different preferences, the
recommendations in this document can be easily adapted.

# Hostname Resolution Query Handling {#query}

When a client has both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity and is trying to
establish a connection with a named host, it needs to send out both
AAAA and A DNS queries. Both queries SHOULD be made as soon after
one another as possible, with the AAAA query made first and
immediately followed by the A query.

Additionally, if the client also wants to receive SVCB / HTTPS
resource records (RRs) {{SVCB}}, it SHOULD issue the SVCB query
immediately before the AAAA and A queries (prioritizing the SVCB query
since it can also include address hints). If the client has only one
of IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity, it still issues the SVCB query prior to
whichever AAAA or A query is appropriate. Note that upon
receiving a SVCB answer, the client might need to issue futher
AAAA and/or A queries to resolve the service name included in
the RR.

Implementations SHOULD NOT wait for all answers to
return before attempting connection establishment. If one query
fails to return or takes significantly longer to return, waiting for
the other answers can significantly delay the connection
establishment of the first one. Therefore, the client SHOULD treat
DNS resolution as asynchronous. Note that if the platform does not
offer an asynchronous DNS API, this behavior can be simulated by
making separate synchronous queries, each on a different thread.

The algorithm for acting upon received answers depends on whether the
client sent out queries for SVCB RRs.

If the client did not request SVCB RRs:

- If a positive AAAA response (a response containing at least one
  valid AAAA RR) is received first, the first IPv6 connection
  attempt is immediately started.
- If a positive A response is received first (which might be due
  to reordering), the client SHOULD wait a short time for the
  AAAA response to ensure that preference is given to IPv6, since
  it is common for the AAAA response to follow the A response by
  a few milliseconds. This delay is referred to as
  the "Resolution Delay". If a negative AAAA response (no error, no
  data) is received within the Resolution Delay period or the AAAA
  response has not been received by the end of the Resolution Delay
  period, the client SHOULD proceed to sorting addresses (see
  {{sorting}}) and staggered connection attempts (see {{connections}}) using
  any IPv4 addresses received so far.

If the client did request SVCB RRs:

- If the client receives any positive response back (containing a valid
  AAAA, A, or SVCB ServiceMode RR), it starts the Resolution Delay timer, which
  is run until both the AAAA and SVCB ServiceMode responses are received,
  or a SVCB response is received that also includes at least one
  address in the `ipv6hint` parameter.
  Once both records are received, or the timer expires, the client
  proceeds with the process of sorting addresses and staggered
  connection attempts.

For both variations of the algorithm, the RECOMMENDED value for
the Resolution Delay is 50 milliseconds.

If new positive responses arrive while connection attempts are in progress,
but before any connection has been established, then the newly
received addresses are incorporated into the list of available candidate
addresses (see {{changes}}) and the process of connection attempts will
continue with the new addresses added, until one connection is
established.

## Handling Multiple DNS Server Addresses

If multiple DNS server addresses are configured for the current
network, the client may have the option of sending its DNS queries
over IPv4 or IPv6. In keeping with the Happy Eyeballs approach,
queries SHOULD be sent over IPv6 first (note that this is not
referring to the sending of AAAA or A queries, but rather the address
of the DNS server itself and IP version used to transport DNS
messages). If DNS queries sent to the IPv6 address do not receive
responses, that address may be marked as penalized and queries can be
sent to other DNS server addresses.

As native IPv6 deployments become more prevalent and IPv4 addresses
are exhausted, it is expected that IPv6 connectivity will have
preferential treatment within networks. If a DNS server is
configured to be accessible over IPv6, IPv6 should be assumed to be
the preferred address family.

Client systems SHOULD NOT have an explicit limit to the number of DNS
servers that can be configured, either manually or by the network.
If such a limit is required by hardware limitations, the client
SHOULD use at least one address from each address family from the
available list.

# Sorting Addresses {#sorting}

Before attempting to connect to any of the resolved destination
addresses, the client should define the order in which to start the
attempts. Once the order has been defined, the client can use a
simple algorithm for racing each option after a short delay (see
{{connections}}). It is important that the ordered list involve all
addresses from both families and all protocols that have been received
by this point, as this allows the client to get the racing effect of
Happy Eyeballs for the entire list, not just the first IPv4 and first
IPv6 addresses.

Note that the following sorting steps are an incremental sort, meaning
that the client SHOULD sort within each sorted group for each
incremental step.

If any of the answers were from SVCB RRs, they SHOULD be sorted ahead
of any answers that were not associated with a SVCB record.

If the client supports TLS Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) discovery through
SVCB records {{!SVCB-ECH=I-D.sbn-tls-svcb-ech}}, depending on the
client's preference to handle ECH, the client SHOULD sort addresses with
ECH keys taking priority to maintain privacy when attempting connection
establishment.

The client then sorts the addresses received up to this point, within
each group, by service priority if the set of addresses contain any
answers from SVCB records. See {{priority}} for details.

The client SHOULD also sort the addresses in protocol order, such that
QUIC is prioritized over TCP, as it connects faster and generally
results in a better experience once connected. For example, QUIC
provides improved delivery and congestion control, supports connection
migration, and provides other benefits {{QUIC}}.

Then, within each group at equal priority, the client MUST sort the
addresses using Destination Address Selection ({{!RFC6724, Section 6}}).

If the client is stateful and has a history of expected round-trip
times (RTTs) for the routes to access each address, it SHOULD add a
Destination Address Selection rule between rules 8 and 9 that prefers
addresses with lower RTTs. If the client keeps track of which
addresses it used in the past, it SHOULD add another Destination
Address Selection rule between the RTT rule and rule 9, which prefers
used addresses over unused ones. This helps servers that use the
client's IP address during authentication, as is the case for TCP
Fast Open {{?RFC7413}} and some Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)
cookies. This historical data MUST NOT be used across different
network interfaces and SHOULD be flushed whenever a device changes
the network to which it is attached.

Next, the client SHOULD modify the ordered list to interleave
protocols and address families. Whichever combination of protocol
and address family is first in the list should be followed by an
address of the other protocol type and same address family, and then
an endpoint from the same protocol and other address family. For example,
if the first address in the sorted list is a QUIC IPv6 address, then
the first TCP IPv6 address should be moved up in the list to be second
in the list, and then the first QUIC IPv4 address should be moved up
in the list to be third in the list. An implementation MAY choose to
favor one protocol or address family more by allowing multiple
addresses of that protocol or family to be attempted before trying the
other combinations. The number of contiguous addresses of the first
combination of properties will be referred to as the "Preferred Protocol
Combination Count" and can be a configurable value. This avoids waiting
through a long list of addresses from a given address family using a
given protocol if connectivity over a protocol or an address family is
impaired.

Note that the address selection described in this section only
applies to destination addresses; Source Address Selection
({{!RFC6724, Section 5}}) is performed once per destination address and
is out of scope of this document.

## Sorting Based on Priority {#priority}
SVCB {{SVCB}} RRs indicate a priority for each ServiceMode response.
This prioirity applies to any IPv4 or IPv6 address hints in the RR
itself, as well as any addresses received on A or AAAA queries for the
name in the Servicemode RR. The priority in a SVCB RR is always
greater than 0.

SVCB answers with the lowest numerical value (such as 1) are sorted
first, and answers with higher numerical values are sorted later.

Note that a SVCB RR with the TargetName "." applies to the owner
name in the RR, and the priority of that SVCB RR applies to
any A or AAAA RRs for the same owner name. These answers are
sorted according to that SVCB RR's priority.

# Connection Attempts {#connections}

Once the list of addresses received up to this point has been
constructed, the client will attempt to make connections. In order
to avoid unreasonable network load, connection attempts SHOULD NOT be
made simultaneously. Instead, one connection attempt to a single
address is started first, followed by the others in the list, one at
a time. Starting a new connection attempt does not affect previous
attempts, as multiple connection attempts may occur in parallel.
Once one of the connection attempts succeeds ({{success}}), all other
connections attempts that have not yet succeeded SHOULD be canceled.
Any address that was not yet attempted as a connection SHOULD be ignored.
At that time, the asynchronous DNS query MAY be canceled as new addresses
will not be used for this connection. However, the DNS client resolver
SHOULD still process DNS replies from the network for a short period of
time (recommended to be 1 second), as they will populate the DNS cache
and can be used for subsequent connections.

A simple implementation can have a fixed delay for how long to wait
before starting the next connection attempt. This delay is referred
to as the "Connection Attempt Delay". One recommended value for a
default delay is 250 milliseconds. A more nuanced implementation's
delay should correspond to the time when the previous attempt is
retrying its handshake (such as sending a second TCP SYN or a second
QUIC Initial), based on the retransmission timer ({{!RFC6298}},
{{?RFC9002}}). If the client has historical RTT data gathered from
other connections to the same host or prefix, it can use this
information to influence its delay. Note that this algorithm should
only try to approximate the time of the first SYN retransmission, and
not any further retransmissions that may be influenced by exponential
timer back off.

The Connection Attempt Delay MUST have a lower bound, especially if
it is computed using historical data. More specifically, a
subsequent connection MUST NOT be started within 10 milliseconds of
the previous attempt. The recommended minimum value is 100
milliseconds, which is referred to as the "Minimum Connection Attempt
Delay". This minimum value is required to avoid congestion collapse
in the presence of high packet-loss rates. The Connection Attempt
Delay SHOULD have an upper bound, referred to as the "Maximum
Connection Attempt Delay". The current recommended value is 2
seconds.

## Determining successful connection establishment {#success}

The determination of when a connection attempt has successfully completed
(and other attempts can be cancelled) depends on the protocols being used
to establish a connection. This can involve one or more protocol handshakes.

Client connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol on top, such
as for unencrypted HTTP connections) will determine successful establishment based
on completing the TCP handshake only. When TLS is used on top of of TCP (such
as for encrypted HTTP connections), clients MAY choose to wait for the TLS handshake to
successfully complete before cancelling other connection attempts. This is particularly
useful for networks in which a TCP-terminating proxy might be causing TCP handshakes
to succeed quickly, even though end-to-end connectivity with the TLS-terminating
server will fail. QUIC connections inherently include a secure handshake in their main
handshakes, and thus only need to wait for a single handshake to complete.

While transport layer handshakes generally do not have restrictions on attempts
to establish a connection, some cryptographic handshakes may be dependent on
ServiceMode SVCB RRs and could impose limitations on establishing a connection.
For instance, ECH-capable clients may become SVCB-reliant clients
({{Section 3 of SVCB}}) when SVCB RRs contain the
"ech" SvcParamKey {{!ECH=I-D.ietf-tls-svcb-ech}}. If the client is either an SVCB-reliant client or a
SVCB-optional client that might switch to SVCB-reliant connection
establishment during the process, the client MUST wait for SVCB RRs before
proceeding with the cryptographic handshake.

## Handling Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

The `alpn` and `no-default-alpn` SvcParamKeys in SVCB RRs indicate the
"SVCB ALPN set," which specifies the underlying transport protocols supported
by the associated service endpoint. When the client requests SVCB RRs, it
SHOULD perform the procedure specified in {{Section 7.1.2 of SVCB}} to determine
the underlying transport protocols that both the client and the service endpoint
support. The client SHOULD NOT attempt to make a connection to a service
endpoint whose SVCB ALPN set does not contain any protocols that the client
supports. For example, suppose the client is an HTTP client that only supports
TCP-based versions such as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and it receives the following
HTTPS RR:

~~~
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc1.example.com. (
     alpn="h3" no-default-alpn ipv6hint=2001:db8::2 )
~~~

In this case, attempting a connection to 2001:db8::2 or any other address resolved
for `svc1.example.com` would be incorrect because the RR indicates that
`svc1.example.com` only supports HTTP/3, based on the ALPN value of "h3".

If the client is an HTTP client that supports both Alt-Svc {{?AltSvc=RFC7838}}
and SVCB (HTTPS) RRs, the client SHOULD ensure that connection attempts are
consistent with both the Alt-Svc parameters and the SVCB ALPN set, as specified
in {{Section 9.3 of SVCB}}.

# DNS Answer Changes During Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup {#changes}

If, during the course of connection establishment, the DNS answers
change by either adding resolved addresses (for example due to DNS
push notifications {{?RFC8765}}) or removing previously resolved
addresses (for example, due to expiry of the TTL on that DNS record),
the client should react based on its current progress.

If an address is removed from the list that already had a connection
attempt started, the connection attempt SHOULD NOT be canceled, but
rather be allowed to continue. If the removed address had not yet
had a connection attempt started, it SHOULD be removed from the list
of addresses to try.

If an address is added to the list, it should be sorted into the list
of addresses not yet attempted according to the rules above (see
{{sorting}}).

# Supporting IPv6-Only Networks with NAT64 and DNS64

While many IPv6 transition protocols have been standardized and
deployed, most are transparent to client devices. The combined use
of NAT64 {{!RFC6146}} and DNS64 {{!RFC6147}} is a popular solution that is
being deployed and requires changes in client devices. One possible
way to handle these networks is for the client device networking
stack to implement 464XLAT {{?RFC6877}}. 464XLAT has the advantage of
not requiring changes to user space software; however, it requires
per-packet translation if the application is using IPv4 literals and
does not encourage client application software to support native
IPv6. On platforms that do not support 464XLAT, the Happy Eyeballs
engine SHOULD follow the recommendations in this section to properly
support IPv6-only networks with NAT64 and DNS64.

The features described in this section SHOULD only be enabled when
the host detects one of these networks. A simple heuristic to
achieve that is to check if the network offers routable IPv6
addressing, does not offer routable IPv4 addressing, and offers a DNS
resolver address.

## IPv4 Address Literals {#literals}

If client applications or users wish to connect to IPv4 address
literals, the Happy Eyeballs engine will need to perform NAT64
address synthesis for them. The solution is similar to "Bump-in-the-
Host" {{!RFC6535}} but is implemented inside the Happy Eyeballs library.

When an IPv4 address is passed into the library instead of a
hostname, the device queries the network for the NAT64 prefix using
"Discovery of the IPv6 Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis"
{{!RFC7050}} and then synthesizes an appropriate IPv6 address (or
several) using the encoding described in "IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/
IPv6 Translators" {{!RFC6052}}. The synthesized addresses are then
inserted into the list of addresses as if they were results from DNS
queries; connection attempts follow the algorithm described above
(see {{connections}}).

## Hostnames with Broken AAAA Records {#broken}

At the time of writing, there exist a small but non-negligible number
of hostnames that resolve to valid A records and broken AAAA records,
which we define as AAAA records that contain seemingly valid IPv6
addresses but those addresses never reply when contacted on the usual
ports. These can be, for example, caused by:

- Mistyping of the IPv6 address in the DNS zone configuration

- Routing black holes

- Service outages

While an algorithm complying with the other sections of this document
would correctly handle such hostnames on a dual-stack network, they
will not necessarily function correctly on IPv6-only networks with
NAT64 and DNS64. Since DNS64 recursive resolvers rely on the
authoritative name servers sending negative ("no error no answer")
responses for AAAA records in order to synthesize, they will not
synthesize records for these particular hostnames and will instead
pass through the broken AAAA record.

In order to support these scenarios, the client device needs to query
the DNS for the A record and then perform local synthesis. Since
these types of hostnames are rare and, in order to minimize load on
DNS servers, this A query should only be performed when the client
has given up on the AAAA records it initially received. This can be
achieved by using a longer timeout, referred to as the "Last Resort
Local Synthesis Delay"; the delay is recommended to be 2 seconds.
The timer is started when the last connection attempt is fired. If
no connection attempt has succeeded when this timer fires, the device
queries the DNS for the IPv4 address and, on reception of a valid A
record, treats it as if it were provided by the application (see
{{literals}}).

## Virtual Private Networks

Some Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may be configured to handle DNS
queries from the device. The configuration could encompass all
queries or a subset such as "*.internal.example.com". These VPNs can
also be configured to only route part of the IPv4 address space, such
as 192.0.2.0/24. However, if an internal hostname resolves to an
external IPv4 address, these can cause issues if the underlying
network is IPv6-only. As an example, let's assume that
"www.internal.example.com" has exactly one A record, 198.51.100.42,
and no AAAA records. The client will send the DNS query to the
company's recursive resolver and that resolver will reply with these
records. The device now only has an IPv4 address to connect to and
no route to that address. Since the company's resolver does not know
the NAT64 prefix of the underlying network, it cannot synthesize the
address. Similarly, the underlying network's DNS64 recursive
resolver does not know the company's internal addresses, so it cannot
resolve the hostname. Because of this, the client device needs to
resolve the A record using the company's resolver and then locally
synthesize an IPv6 address, as if the resolved IPv4 address were
provided by the application ({{literals}}).

# Summary of Configurable Values

The values that may be configured as defaults on a client for use in
Happy Eyeballs are as follows:

- Resolution Delay ({{query}}): The time to wait for a AAAA response
after receiving an A response. Recommended to be 50 milliseconds.

- Preferred Protocol Combination Count ({{sorting}}): The number of
addresses belonging to the preferred address family (such as IPv6) using
the preferred protocol (such as QUIC) that should be attempted before
attempting the next combination of address family and protocol.
Recommended to be 1; 2 may be used to more aggressively favor a
particular combination of address family and protocol.

- Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The time to wait between
connection attempts in the absence of RTT data. Recommended to be
250 milliseconds.

- Minimum Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The minimum time to
wait between connection attempts. Recommended to be 100
milliseconds. MUST NOT be less than 10 milliseconds.

- Maximum Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The maximum time to
wait between connection attempts. Recommended to be 2 seconds.

- Last Resort Local Synthesis Delay ({{broken}}): The time to wait
after starting the last IPv6 attempt and before sending the A
query. Recommended to be 2 seconds.

The delay values described in this section were determined
empirically by measuring the timing of connections on a very wide set
of production devices. They were picked to reduce wait times noticed
by users while minimizing load on the network. As time passes, it is
expected that the properties of networks will evolve. For that
reason, it is expected that these values will change over time.
Implementors should feel welcome to use different values without
changing this specification. Since IPv6 issues are expected to be
less common, the delays SHOULD be increased with time as client
software is updated.

# Limitations

Happy Eyeballs will handle initial connection failures at the transport
layer (such as TCP or QUIC); however, other failures or performance
issues may still affect the chosen connection.

## Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery

For TCP connections, since Happy Eyeballs is only active during the
initial handshake and TCP does not pass the initial handshake, issues
related to MTU can be masked and go unnoticed during Happy Eyeballs.
For QUIC connections, a minimum MTU of at least 1200 bytes
{{!RFC9000, Section 8.1-5}} is guaranteed, but there is a chance that
larger values may not be available. Solving this issue is out of scope
of this document. One solution is to use "Packetization Layer Path MTU
Discovery" {{!RFC4821}}.

## Application Layer

If the DNS returns multiple addresses for different application
servers, the application itself may not be operational and functional
on all of them. Common examples include Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and HTTP.

## Hiding Operational Issues

It has been observed in practice that Happy Eyeballs can hide issues
in networks. For example, if a misconfiguration causes IPv6 to
consistently fail on a given network while IPv4 is still functional,
Happy Eyeballs may impair the operator's ability to notice the issue.
It is recommended that network operators deploy external means of
monitoring to ensure functionality of all address families.

# Security Considerations

Note that applications should not rely upon a stable hostname-to-
address mapping to ensure any security properties, since DNS results
may change between queries. Happy Eyeballs may make it more likely
that subsequent connections to a single hostname use different IP
addresses.

# IANA Considerations

This document does not require any IANA actions.
